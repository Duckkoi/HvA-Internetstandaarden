            <h1>What spirits are</h1>
            <p><i>(Spirits and blighted spirits are simply titles given to them by the main cast, every group may have a different name for them.)</i></p>
            <p><u>Spirits are the supernatural, they cause things such as waterfalls that flow up and grass sprouts that are too big.</u> 
               They also cause a lot of  weird shapes in nature, such as crescent mountain or donut shaped flying islands.  
               <u>The more spirits there are in an area the weirder the happenings can be and the more often they appear.</u> Spirits do not have a set shape, size or color, 
               though they are all weightless. All they do is float around, some are more curious or cautious than others, but they tend to stay away from humans. 
               <u>Due to large concentrations of spirits being rare near humans, the terrain around civilization is very normal, 
               unlike the very deep wild where anything could happen.</u></p>

            <p><u>When given time, spirits start change and gain abilities according to their environment, which is an effect of their growth, 
               this is also the reason they stay away from humans, which influence their growth too much.</u> If a spirit is in the middle of an ocean, 
               it could gain abilities like turning into water, creating salt or even shooting turtle shells. <u>Spirits are able to possess objects, 
               animals and humans. When a spirit possesses one of these, it does not gain the ability to control its body.</u>
               There are a few rules for a spirit possessing objects, animals and humans, <u>plants fall under objects.</u></p>

            <ol>
                <li>If a spirit possesses an object: It can be used, but it can't do anything major by itself.</li>
                <li>If a spirit possesses an animal: The animal could learn how to control it through instinct. but it also has the change to ignore it.</li>
                <li>If a spirit possesses a human: The human will gain its abilities, though it must be practiced just like writing and walking.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Spirits are 'born' as an effect of spirits doing supernatural things. They 'die' after specializing so long that they become 'it', for example a blade of grass.</p>
        </div>


        <div>
           <h2>Blighted spirit</h2> 
           <p>Just like any other creature, spirits have stamina. When its stamina gets fully expended it changes into a blighted spirit. 
              Unlike spirits, blighted spirits do not have a special ability and are all generally the same, when a spirit changes into a blighted spirit, 
              it loses its previous ability and becomes prone to changing and becomes completely adaptive, when near humans it can even learn their language.</p>
           <P>This map was based off of the idea that it was first one continent, purely so it looked realistic. 
              <u>Through colors you can see what areas humans know about as a whole and through color-code you can see what areas can interact and know about each other.</u>
              For example red knows about red, but doesn't know about green. <u>Not all areas in the colored regions are actually inhabitable, 
              it purely means that they know about it.</u> (The colors on this map aren't accurate, they're just there as explanation)</P>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 id="howterrainworks">How terrain works</h2>
            <p>Floating rivers and upside-down forests are all easily possible. <u>Most of the supernatural events and terrain are caused by spirits.</u>
                Since there are less spirits around humans and they cause the supernatural, the terrain around civilization is normal compared to the wild, 
                where there are more spirits and are as a result more supernatural. <u>You can also think of it as density, 
                the denser the concentration of spirits is the more supernatural it is.</u> There is no true and clear way to predict terrain in the wild.</p>
