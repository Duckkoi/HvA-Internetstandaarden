        <h1>What spirits are</h1>
        <p>
          <i
            >(Spirits and blighted spirits are simply titles given to them by
            the main cast, every group may have a different name for them.)</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <u
            >Spirits are the supernatural, they cause things such as waterfalls
            that flow up and grass sprouts that are too big.</u
          >
          They also cause a lot of weird shapes in nature, such as crescent
          mountain or donut shaped flying islands.
          <u
            >The more spirits there are in an area the weirder the happenings
            can be and the more often they appear.</u
          >
          Spirits do not have a set shape, size or color, though they are all
          weightless. All they do is float around, some are more curious or
          cautious than others, but they tend to stay away from humans.
          <u
            >Due to large concentrations of spirits being rare near humans, the
            terrain around civilization is very normal, unlike the very deep
            wild where anything could happen.</u
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          <u
            >When given time, spirits start change and gain abilities according
            to their environment, which is an effect of their growth, this is
            also the reason they stay away from humans, which influence their
            growth too much.</u
          >
          If a spirit is in the middle of an ocean, it could gain abilities like
          turning into water, creating salt or even shooting turtle shells.
          <u
            >Spirits are able to possess objects, animals and humans. When a
            spirit possesses one of these, it does not gain the ability to
            control its body.</u
          >
          There are a few rules for a spirit possessing objects, animals and
          humans, <u>plants fall under objects.</u>
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            If a spirit possesses an object: It can be used, but it can't do
            anything major by itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a spirit possesses an animal: The animal could learn how to
            control it through instinct. but it also has the change to ignore
            it.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a spirit possesses a human: The human will gain its abilities,
            though it must be practiced just like writing and walking.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Spirits are 'born' as an effect of spirits doing supernatural things.
          They 'die' after specializing so long that they become 'it', for
          example a blade of grass.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 id="blightedspirits">Blighted spirit</h2>
        <p>
          Just like any other creature, spirits have stamina. When its stamina
          gets fully expended it changes into a blighted spirit. Unlike spirits,
          blighted spirits do not have a special ability and are all generally
          the same, when a spirit changes into a blighted spirit, it loses its
          previous ability and becomes prone to changing and becomes completely
          adaptive, when near humans it can even learn their language.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since they are still the same species they still have the ability to
          make supernatural things happen, and if they become intelligent they
          could even control it.
          <u>Instead of abilities it could be said that they have talents.</u>
          There are again a few rules for a blighted spirit possessing objects,
          animals and humans.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            If a spirit possessing an object becomes a blighted spirit: The
            object breaks or rots with the blighted spirit leaving it
          </li>
          <li>
            If a spirit possessing an animal becomes a blighted spirit: The
            blighted spirit leaves the body, leaving the animal to die or morph
            / The animal now more survivability replacing the old abilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a spirit possessing a human becomes a blighted spirit: The
            blighted leave the body, leaving the human or dead or with paralyzed
            limbs and organ failure or anything similar / The human now has more
            survivability replacing the old abilities.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The new abilities or 'talents' a blighted spirit has when possessing a
          human or animal exist to preserve the body.
          <u
            >They all have the aptitude to learn skills such as nullifying
            poisons, regenerating which could even lead to leaving the host
            immortal,</u
          >
          though they all excel in different areas. They still have an impact on
          supernatural events.
          <u
            >Just like spirits, the abilities of blighted spirits can be
            controlled,</u
          >
          which means that regenerating on command is possible which is called
          over-regenerating.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over-regenerating can lead to transmutating the body with
          possibilities such as growing nails, hardening the body and even
          extending outside the body. Side effects when regenerating are heating
          up, nausea, tardiness, nosebleeds and sensitivity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Blighted spirits can not 'die' in the same way as spirits as they do
          not grow in the ordinary way. Destroying or killing whatever it's
          inhabiting does 'kill' it though, blighted spirits are essentially
          weakened.
