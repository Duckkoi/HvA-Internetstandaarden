        <div class="amirbio">

            Muthaliar and Mina Muthaliar, he used to live with his parents and
            his brother Raja in the country of Saltzar. He has multiple names,
            Amir is the name given to him by Sarah Hajjar as no one knew his
            real name in Alsahriqa, Rajesh is his birthname paired with the name

          </p>

      <div>
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>
          Amir is well-built with black ruffled, braided hair with a warm ivory
          skin tone. His eyes are a very grayish black. His iris also has a
          white crescent that changes shape depending on his mood (This is a
          design choice that the weirder characters get). Amir also has scars,
          one noticeable one on his right hand and between his left shoulder and
          neck, together with many lighter ones over his body. He normally wears
          robes and wooden Geta sandals.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>
          Amir was originally a playful and curious kid, but as time passed and
          his father dying in war he became more foul-mouthed, stubborn and
          rebellious. After the Wilds Invasion that went over his kingdom, he
          got the jumbled memories of nearly all people in the country, this
          caused him to become monotone, robot-like, not knowing anything about
          himself and incapable of making decisions. As he develops he becomes
          more decisive, manipulative and confident, caused by people around
          him.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          From a young age Amir was a cheerful and cheeky kid that aspired to
          join the army just like his father Rajiv Muthaliar and become a war
          hero. He used to have a small group of friends that he always played
          with. One of them was named Devi Prasad and was often seen together
          with him. One day he decided to go the ancient ruins outside Saltzar,
          which ended up with Devi following him. After exploring for a while
          Amir falls down a hill into a small grotto. He continued to explore
          the grotto and eventually found what looked like a hidden underground
          lake. Some hours had passed after he fell down and was found, in this
          grotto he had his first interaction with ----------------------. Since
          then their group of friends periodically went to their secret cave.
        </p>

        <p>
          After his father died in war the people around Amir came to pity him
          and his family, because of this he got too eager to follow in his
          father's and brother's footsteps. This ended with him becoming
          foul-mouthed, rebellious and aggressive, cause of this and his mother
          becoming more mentally ill and abusive he ended up getting kicked out
          of his home. Only two of his friends including Devi Prasad stayed with
          him during this duration.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the Wilds Invasion came. His mother was away and his brother came
          rushing to escape with Amir, but they couldn't fully escape. As Amir
          got caught up in the Wilds Incursion he received the memories of
          nearly everyone in the country.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Relationships</h2>
        <h3><a href="azhar.html">Azhar Hajjar</a></h3>
        <p>
          Azhar acts as Amir's decisionmaker when he can't as he is the most
          mature out of all of them. Normally Amir walks besides Azhar when
          traveling as its convenient for the trio. Amir normally seeks approval
          from Azhar when he takes his actions. At first they didn't talk a lot
          to each other, but as time went on then talk about the most random
          things. Azhar doesn't show it, but he secretly gets proud of Amir and
          thinks of him like a little brother just like Sarah. He is travelling
          with Amir and Sarah.
        </p>

        <h3>Devi Prasad</h3>
        <p>
          Devi was his best friend when Amir lived in Saltzar. Out of the 6
          friends Amir had, only two of them including Devi regularly checked up
          on him while he was locked inside. Before Amir was banned from going
          outside. Devi was normally always seen near Amir and rarely on her
          own. She seemed indifferent to her friends, though she did like them.
        </p>

        <h3>Raja Muthaliar</h3>
        <p>
          Before the incursion, Amir and Raja had a healthy relationship. Raja
          was the role model for Amir as they were both joining the army, he
          also constantly talked Amir and gave him money, but besides that they
          didn't see each other very much. After the Wilds Incursion Raja felt
          like Amir was haunting him as he wanted to move on from what happened.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="sarah.html">Sarah Hajjar</a></h3>
        <p>
          The name Amir has been given to him by Sarah, she acts like a
          dependable and mature big sister figure that overly spoils him,
          although it isn't even sure that she's older than him. At first Amir
          lets her do anything she wants to him and also follows her around, but
          later on he resists a bit more. He also copies what she says once in a
          while which ends with Azhar getting harassed by not only Sarah, but
          also Amir. She is travelling with Amir and Azhar.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <h3>Improvised incendiary</h3>
        <p>
          Amir always has 4+ self made incendiary grenades that he makes with
          anything he can find, for example: tree sap, dried leaves and peat
          which he ignites by compressing and increasing heat.
        </p>

        <h3>Modified geta</h3>
        <p>
          Amir wears a pair of wooden Geta, his right one is modified with a
          blade which springs out of the front, if he slides the gear. It's
          poorly made and has a chance to fail as its improvised.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Abilities & Conditions</h2>
        <h3>Memories</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the many memories Amir has received, he has a lot of knowledge
          about travel, exploration, caving, leadership, chemistry, ect, but
          also martial arts, which include mostly boxing, wrestling, grappling,
          one handed sword and polearm styles, though he doesn't use them very
          well as he hasn't professionally trained before and every memory had
          different opinions and habits.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <a href="../worldpages/spirits.html#blightedspirits"
            >Blighted spirit</a
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          Due to Amir's blighted spirit, he has heightened senses to a level
          higher than every day animals. He also eventually gains the ability to
          harden parts of body and do slight body transmutations, such as
          growing his nails. Unlike most blighted spirit hosts, Amir can still
          get poisoned very easily which is his biggest weakness, and cannot
          regenerate as fast as most. This is because his blighted spirit is
          mostly being used to manage his head and memories, so he can function.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="../worldpages/spirits.html">Spirit</a></h3>
        <p>
          Amir's spirit allows him to control the pressure he creates with his
          body. This means increasing the force by decreasing area of effect and
          the reverse. This gives him various options that he utilizes: Hitting
          an opponent by hitting another object, stronger punching force,
          ignoring defenses, make his hits slice and even compress which
          generates heat. By generating heat, Amir is capable of burning,
          melting and even vaporizing. He uses this to ignite his incendiaries.
          He can also more than double his running speed and jumping strength by
          changing his forces of nature's directions and making them him
          propulse his direction. This is all difficult to perform and can be
          dangerous, this means he usually doesn't do this.
