        <h1>Sarah Hajjar</h1>
        <p>
          Sarah Hajjar is one of the two deuteragonists and traveling companions
          of <a href="amir.html">Amir</a>. She is the daughter of Uthman Hajjar
          and Fahima Hajjar. Even though Sarah is called a treasure of
          Aintidina, she has a two sided personality with the sweet side being a
          facade.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>
          Sarah is a young, thin girl. She has an almond skin tone and long,
          violet tinted hair. Her eyes have a purple hue. Her attire always
          changes, cause she wants to be completely immersed in the country. She
          also has a mole under her right eye.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>
          Sarah has a double sided personality. When not alone with Azhar or
          Amir she acts kind and forgiving, but when she isn't with strangers
          her ego gets larger and she becomes bold, smug and prideful. She also
          loves influence and wealth.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Sarah was born in Aintidina. After a few years the village made her
          out to be girl that would become the kindest and most beautiful woman
          in all of Alsahriqa, at first she really liked those claims, but after
          growing up it became a burden. Her uncle, a merchant, was one of the
          only people that didn't treat her differently, so she felt at home
          with him. She sometimes went to the big city together with him to pass
          time away from the village, there she picked up the skill of trading
          and negotiating.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Relationships</h2>
        <h3><a href="amir.html">Amir</a></h3>
        <p>
          The name Amir has been given to him by Sarah Hajjar, she acts like a
          dependable and mature big sister figure that overly spoils him,
          although it isn't even sure that she's older than him. At first Amir
          lets her do anything she wants to him and also follows her around, but
          later on he resists a bit more. He also copies what she says once in a
          while which ends with Azhar getting harassed by not only Sarah, but
          also Amir. She is travelling with Amir and Azhar.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="azhar.html">Azhar Hajjar</a></h3>
        <p>
          Azhar is the older brother of Sarah. When they were younger Azhar used
          to follow around his sister, this was cause of him being 'the
          village's treasure, elder brother' and trying to live up to their
          expectations. They are close enough for Sarah to act normal around him
          and they also bicker. After setting sail with Amir, Azhar begins to
          talk back to Sarah and corrects her. He also teaches her basic
          spearmanship and tool usage.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <h3>Polearm</h3>
        <p>
          A spear with a medium to small spearhead and an extra horizontal blade
          next to the tip.
        </p>

        <h3>Bag</h3>
        <p>
          A bag that almost always contains the money pouch of trio, firefly
          lantern, roll of cloth, rope coil, 2x water pouch, 5x small knives,
          machete + ecology, biology, geology, random and booksRandom purchases.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Abilities & Conditions</h2>
        <h3>Spear</h3>
        <p>
          Sarah wields a spear with a dagger horizontally attached to the
          spearhead, which she uses to stab and pull enemies. She doesn't
          practice any professional martial arts, but has Azhar help her with
          her technique and flaws. She uses a combination of hand to hand combat
          and her spear. She mostly uses her momentum to her advantage instead
          of professional techniques.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="../worldpages/spirits.html">Spirit</a></h3>
        <p>
          Sarah's spirit allows her to create illusions. She summons two giant
          eyes, the eyes go to opposite locations and allow Sarah to create
          illusions in whatever is in both their line of sights, later on she
          can distort multiple senses at a time and make bigger changes.
