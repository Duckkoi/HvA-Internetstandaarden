        <h1>Azhar Hajjar</h1>
        <p>
          Azhar Hajjar is one of the two deuteragonists and traveling companions
          of <a href="amir.html">Amir</a>. He is the son of Uthman Hajjar and
          Fahima Hajjar. Azhar looks like a very serious and menacing person,
          but he isn't anything like that.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>
          Azhar is a tall and well-built guy. He has short dark purple tinted
          hair and eyes which have a dark blue and purple mix. Just like his
          sister he has an almond skin tone. His eyes are sharp and thin. Cause
          of sister his attire also changes according to the norms of the
          settlement or area.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>
          People generally get the wrong impression of Azhar, thinking he's
          aggressive and sketchy, even though he's actually nothing like that.
          Azhar is the most understanding and sympathizing out of the main
          characters, there are a few people including Sarah which he doesn't
          act as friendly with. When in a new settlement one of the first things
          he does is look at the female inhabitants, for multiple reasons.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Since young he has been tasked with monitoring and protecting his
          sister, Sarah. The members of their village looked at Sarah as a
          treasure and thought of Azhar as her guard. At first he found it a bit
          annoying, but quickly got used to his role. His days consisted only of
          following Sarah and then spending time with Hasib Dagher, which he
          viewed as his tutor. Most of the knowledge Azhar has comes from Hasib,
          for example spear techniques and reading. One day while following
          Sarah, he realizes what she's really like, this is when they open up
          to each other and start bickering.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Relationships</h2>
        <h3><a href="amir.html">Amir</a></h3>
        <p>
          When out in the wild Amir always listens to Azhar. This is cause of
          Azhar being older, he also asks a lot of questions to Azhar about how
          to do stuff like fishing, cause even though he has the memories, he
          wants to have a 'correct' way. Amir comes to him for approval of most
          things and even later on this doesn't change. They have a very healthy
          relationship.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="sarah.html">Sarah Hajjar</a></h3>
        <p>
          Sarah's initial impression of Azhar wasn't really clear, all she
          though was that he was a pain since she couldn't be alone anywhere
          with him following her. After Azhar catches Sarah's real personality
          he was a bit weirded out, but it made it easier for Sarah to be
          herself. Now Sarah and Azhar bicker a lot, but they can still work
          together, though not if it comes to Amir since they both want
          different things from him.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <h3>Polearm</h3>
        <p>
          A halberd with a long head and a hook on its head. He mostly uses his
          halberd to fling people around. His spearmanship is a mix of what he
          learned in Alsahriqa and experience in the outside world.
        </p>

        <h3>Bag</h3>
        <p>
          A big bag that almost always contains a roll of cloth, rope coil,
          fishing net, fishing rod, sack of grubs, machete, large rope net,
          large cloth, 2x water pouch, 4x throwing spear, Sarah's random
          purchases.
